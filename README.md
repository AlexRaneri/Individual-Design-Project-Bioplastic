Following a group design project on bioplastic production, I performed an individual design project on the drum dryer used in the process.
The objective of the project was to produce a bioplastic film for food packaging, from waste cheese 
whey. Drum speed was determined through calculation, although control loops were 
devised to vary this depending on rate of drying of the plastic. Steam pressure and flow, as well as 
plastic flow could also be varied through control loops. A PI loop was used to control local plastic 
moisture content using an infrared thermometer and induction heaters. Pressure loss inside the drum 
was determined negligible compared to pressure drop of the steam. Thus, design did not consider 
pressure losses or the effects of this. Expansion effects of metals due to temperature and friction, as 
well as volume loss of knife were considered through calculation. Further optimisation is required to 
determine the extent of the influence of these factors on unit operation.
